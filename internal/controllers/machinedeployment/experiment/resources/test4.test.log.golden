## 3 Replicas, In-place rollout, maxSurge 0, MaxUnavailable 1

[Test] Initial state
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 3/3 replicas (m1,m2,m3)
[Test] Rollout 3 replicas, MaxSurge=0, MaxUnavailable=1
[MD controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 3/2 replicas (m1,m2,m3)
  - ms2, 0/0 replicas ()
[MS controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] - ms1 scale down to 2/2 replicas (m1 moved to ms2)
[MS controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile ms2
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m1 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m1 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
[MD controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 2/1 replicas (m2,m3)
  - ms2, 1/1 replicas (m1)
[MS controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] - ms1 scale down to 1/1 replicas (m2 moved to ms2)
[MS controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile ms2
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m2 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m2 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
[MD controller] Iteration 3, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 1/0 replicas (m3)
  - ms2, 2/2 replicas (m1,m2)
[MS controller] Iteration 3, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] - ms1 scale down to 0/0 replicas (m3 moved to ms2)
[MS controller] Iteration 3, Reconcile ms2
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m3 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m3 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
[MD controller] Iteration 4, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 0/0 replicas ()
  - ms2, 3/3 replicas (m1,m2,m3)
[MS controller] Iteration 4, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] Iteration 4, Reconcile ms2
[Test] Final state
  md, 3/3 replicas
  - ms1, 0/0 replicas ()
  - ms2, 3/3 replicas (m1,m2,m3)
