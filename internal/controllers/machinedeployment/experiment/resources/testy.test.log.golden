## 6 Replicas, In-place  maxSurge 3, MaxUnavailable 1

[Test] Initial state
  md, 6/6 replicas
  - ms1, 6/6 replicas (m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6)
[Test] Rollout 6 replicas, MaxSurge=3, MaxUnavailable=1
[MS controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile ms1
[MD controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 6/6 replicas
  - ms1, 6/5 replicas (m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6)
  - ms2, 0/3 replicas ()
[MS controller] Iteration 1, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] - ms1 scale down to 5/5 replicas (m1 moved to ms2)
[MS controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile ms2
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m1 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 scale up to 3/3 replicas (m7,m8 created)
[MD controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile md
[MD controller] - Result of rollout planner
  md, 8/6 replicas
  - ms1, 5/2 replicas (m2,m3,m4,m5,m6)
  - ms2, 3/4 replicas (m1,m7,m8)
[MS controller] Iteration 2, Reconcile ms1
[MS controller] - ms1 scale down to 2/2 replicas (m2,m3,m4 moved to ms2)
[MS controller] Iteration 3, Reconcile ms2
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m2 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m3 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 acknowledge replica m4 moved from an old MachineSet
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m2 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m3 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
[MS controller] - ms2 deferring scale down of 1 replica (m4 moved from an old MachineSet, still pending MD acknowledge)
